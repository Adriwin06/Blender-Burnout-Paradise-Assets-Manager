# Blender Burnout Batch Assets Import
A simple Blender script to batch import different Burnout Paradise assets into Blender using DGIorio's Burnout Paradise Blender tools.

## How to use
Install it like a normal Blender add-on, and if you don't see the option `Batch Import Burnout Paradise (.dat, .BIN, .BNDL)` under `file->import` depsite having the script installed and enabled, then copy-paste the content in the `Script` Blender tab and run it, the option should appear now.
/!\ You need to have [DGIorio's Burnout Paradise Blender tools](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14rUHXb6-Pvbi-Bxcg-CWJaEEjGtFpV-4/view) installed.
